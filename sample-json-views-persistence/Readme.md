# sample-json-views-persistence

The _sample-json-views-persistence_ module is a common library that is used by the sample projects to demonstrate using @JsonView annotations in a Spring Boot service.

This project uses Spring Data JPA, JDK 1.8, an H2 in memory database, and MapStruct to map from entities to Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).
